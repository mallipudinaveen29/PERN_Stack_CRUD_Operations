# PERN Stack CRUD Application
This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
## Features
- Create: Add new entries to the database.
- Read: View a list of entries from the database.
- Update: Edit existing entries.
- Delete: Remove entries from the database.
## Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
## Environment Setup for React and Node.js
This guide outlines the steps to set up the development environment for a project utilizing React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm: Node.js is required to run JavaScript on the server side and npm is the package manager for Node.js. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
  
## Setting up React (Frontend)
## 1. Create a React App
To create a new React app, run the following command:
```
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
```
## 2.Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the development server:
```
npm run start
```
## Setting up Node.js (Backend)
## 1. Create a New Node.js Project
Create a new directory for your Node.js project and navigate into it:
```
mkdir backend
cd backend
```
## 2. Initialize Node.js Project
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
```
npm init -y
```
## 3. Install Necessary Packages
Install required packages such as Express.js for building the server:
```
npm install express pg cors nodemon
```
## 4. Create Server Files
Create server files (e.g., index.js) and write the code for your backend application using Node.js and Express.js.
## 5. Start the Node.js Server
To start the Node.js server, run:
```
nodemon index.js
```
